A few months ago, I built a tic-tac-toe game using jQuery for a TeamTreeHouse project.
Now I'm learning React, and I decided it'd be a fun challenge to rewrite the app.
It looks and behaves almost the same, but I've made a few changes/improvements.
This is a way for me to measure my progress, and get some practice with a new framework.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To play, download the files,<br>

### `npm install`

Install all dependencies<br>

### `npm start`

And run the app!<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
